### React-Redux-Typescript boilerplate

### How to

Start development: `yarn start`

### Packing

Code structure is grouped by feature. For example, the menu folder contains all the elements associated to the menu component: reducers, actions, builders, sub-components, utils, state, action types and selectors.  
The index is produced in order to enable indexing all the elements of the folder in one exported object.
